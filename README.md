##Notes:

The main part of the game we created during class with the instructors help.
The second part was for us to add in our own features.

For my additions, I added a particle shield, created a Game Over screen and add a computer voice.

(This project is comment heavy as we were taking notes in class.)

We used the book "Build iOS Games with Sprite Kit".
